# neural_networks_learining
This project implements a simple neural network in Python using popular machine learning libraries to recognize characters from a sequence of images or data. It is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate the basics of character recognition using artificial intelligence.

- Recognizes characters from a given series (e.g. handwritten or typed text images)
- Uses existing Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras
- Includes data preprocessing and normalization
- Easy to train and test with minimal setup
